Why Mean Stack JS
-----------------

Do you need a full stack solution that is easy to build and all javascript?  Then you're in the right place with Mean Stack JS. There is no steep learning curve and it only takes an average of 10 minutes to get your base code up and running.  We've made the development process as simple and scalable as possible. This is perfect for anyone involved in software development, including User Experience Designers, Quality Assurance Engineers, Software Engineers, Frontend Developers, Backend Developers and Full Stack Engineers.

What is Mean Stack JS Lite ?
-----------------

This repo is a stripped down version of the main meanstackjs. This repo will be great for you if you want to totally control every last part of your stack. This repo will also be for the purpose of teaching or if you want just the base functionally. Please refer to all live documentation back at [MeanStackJS](https://github.com/greenpioneersolutions/meanstackjs/wiki)

Stack
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - based framework. -AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
- [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) - Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, we recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/greenpioneersolutions/meanstackjs-lite.git

# Change directory
cd meanstackjs-lite

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Start up the server
npm start
# or
node server.js
# or
nodemon server.js
```

**Note:** We highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node index.js` use `nodemon index.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.
